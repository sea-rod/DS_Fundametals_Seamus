Poor Service and Long Wait. I had to wait forever to get my drink, and when I finally did, it was wrong. The staff seemed overwhelmed and not very friendly.
Disappointing Experience. I visited Starbucks last week, and the experience was disappointing. The baristas were rude, and my coffee wasn’t even hot when I got it.
Bad Customer Service. I had a really poor experience. The staff was rude and didn’t seem to care about customer service. I won’t be returning to this location.
