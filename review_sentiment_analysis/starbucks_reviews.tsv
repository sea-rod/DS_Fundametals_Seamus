Consistently Good Coffee. No matter which Starbucks I visit, I can always count on consistent quality. Their coffee and snacks are always fresh, and the service is quick.	Positive
Decent Coffee, but a Bit Pricey. Starbucks coffee is good, but I find it a bit expensive compared to other local cafes. It’s convenient though, especially with their mobile ordering.	Neutral
Nice Place, but Always Crowded. I like the drinks at Starbucks, but it’s always so packed that it’s hard to find a place to sit. It’s better to grab your coffee to go.	Neutral
Good Variety, But Wish for More Dairy-Free Options. Starbucks offers a good variety of drinks, but I wish they had more dairy-free options. Almond and oat milk are great, but a little more variety would be appreciated.	Neutral
Decent Coffee, Average Snacks. I enjoy Starbucks’ coffee, but their food options are just average. The pastries could be fresher. It's a good spot for a quick coffee, though.	Neutral
Good Coffee, Long Wait Times. The coffee here is solid, but the lines can be frustrating, especially during busy times. The mobile order feature helps, but even then, you sometimes have to wait.	Neutral
Starbucks is Just Okay. I’m not the biggest fan of Starbucks. The drinks are fine, but there are better local options around. It’s convenient, though, if you’re in a rush.	Neutral
Good for Quick Coffee, But Nothing Special. Starbucks is reliable for a quick coffee, but I don’t find their drinks extraordinary. It’s just a convenient option when I need something fast.	Neutral
Pretty Good, but Overhyped. Starbucks has good drinks, but I think they’re a bit overhyped. It’s a decent coffee chain, but there are better, more affordable options out there.	Neutral
Convenient but Overcrowded. Starbucks is always convenient, but it’s often too crowded to enjoy a quiet coffee. It’s a good option for takeout, though.	Neutral
Consistent Coffee, but Not Special. Starbucks is reliable, but the coffee isn’t anything to write home about. It’s consistent, though, and the staff is usually nice.	Neutral
Too Expensive for Mediocre Coffee. I find Starbucks way too expensive for the quality of coffee they serve. There are so many better local options that offer stronger and tastier coffee.	Negative
Poor Service and Long Wait. I had to wait forever to get my drink, and when I finally did, it was wrong. The staff seemed overwhelmed and not very friendly.	Negative
Overrated and Overpriced. Starbucks is just overrated. The coffee is nothing special, and I can’t justify the prices. Plus, the lines are always long.	Negative
Inconsistent Drink Quality. I’ve been to multiple Starbucks locations, and the drink quality is inconsistent. Sometimes it’s great, other times it’s watered down or way too sweet.	Negative
Coffee Tastes Burnt. I don't understand the hype around Starbucks. The coffee always tastes burnt to me, and the prices are outrageous for what you get.	Negative
Disappointing Experience. I visited Starbucks last week, and the experience was disappointing. The baristas were rude, and my coffee wasn’t even hot when I got it.	Negative
Noisy and Uncomfortable Atmosphere. I find Starbucks too noisy, and the seating is uncomfortable. It's not a good place to relax or get work done in my opinion.	Negative
Bad Customer Service. I had a really poor experience. The staff was rude and didn’t seem to care about customer service. I won’t be returning to this location.	Negative
Drinks Are Overly Sweet. The drinks are way too sugary, and it’s hard to customize them to your taste. Even when I ask for less sugar, it’s still too sweet.	Negative
Not Worth the Hype. Starbucks is way overrated. The drinks are bland, and the prices are too high for what you get. I’d rather go to a local café.	Negative
