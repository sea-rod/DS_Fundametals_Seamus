# [Find the middle element](middle_element_ex1)

Given a singly linked list, find the middle element of the list in
O(n) time complexity, where
n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

If the number of nodes is odd, return the value of the middle node.
If the number of nodes is even, return the value of the first of the two middle nodes.
