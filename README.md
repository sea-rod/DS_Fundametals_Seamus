# [Find the middle element](middle_element_ex1)

Given a singly linked list, find the middle element of the list in
O(n) time complexity, where
n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

- If the number of nodes is odd, return the value of the middle node.
- If the number of nodes is even, return the value of the first of the two middle nodes.

# [Student Marks](student_marks)

You are provided with a CSV file that contains student data with the following columns:

`gender`: The gender of the student (either "Male" or "Female").
`maths`: The student's score in Maths.
`english`: The student's score in English.
Your task is to:

1. Visualize Gender Distribution:

   - Create a pie chart to show the distribution of students based on gender.

2. Pass/Fail Classification:
   - A student is considered to have passed if the sum of their Maths and English scores is greater than 40, otherwise, they have failed.
   - Create a pie chart to represent the distribution of students who have passed and failed.
