# [Find the middle element](middle_element_ex1)

Given a singly linked list, find the middle element of the list in
O(n) time complexity, where
n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

- If the number of nodes is odd, return the value of the middle node.
- If the number of nodes is even, return the value of the first of the two middle nodes.

# [Student Marks](student_marks)

You are provided with a CSV file that contains student data with the following columns:

`gender`: The gender of the student (either "Male" or "Female").

`maths`: The student's score in Maths.

`english`: The student's score in English.

## Your task is to:

### 1. Read the CSV File:
Use Python's built-in `open()` function to read the CSV file without relying on any additional libraries (such as pandas or csv).

### 2. Visualize Gender Distribution:

   - Create a pie chart to show the distribution of students based on gender.

### 3. Pass/Fail Classification:
   - A student is considered to have passed if the sum of their Maths and English scores is greater than 40, otherwise, they have failed.
   - Create a pie chart to represent the distribution of students who have passed and failed.

# [Matrix Multiplication of Two 3x3 Matrices from CSV Files](matrix_multiplication)
This project reads two CSV files containing 3x3 matrices, multiplies them, and writes the result to a new CSV file using Python's built-in `open()` function.

## Your task is to:

### 1. Read CSV Files
- Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `open()` function to read two CSV files, where each file contains a 3x3 matrix.

### 2. Matrix Multiplication
Perform matrix multiplication on the two 3x3 matrices.

### 3. Store the Result
Write the result of the matrix multiplication to a new CSV file using Python's `open()` function.
